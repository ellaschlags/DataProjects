# Data Projects: Learning Statistics with Pythonüòç

Welcome to my data projects repository! This repository serves as a space for me to familiarize myself with computing statistics using Python. The projects here are more basic exploratory data analysis. I want to gradually improve my understanding of Python and data science principles, and this is a great way to share my progress!

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

- Explore real-world datasets
- Practice statistical concepts such as probability, hypothesis testing, regression, and more
- Familiarize myself with Python libraries for data analysis, including:
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation
  - **NumPy** for numerical computations
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
  - **SciPy** and **Statsmodels** for statistical analysis
